        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Japanese curry is different from Indian or Thai curries. It is more of a 
            brown stew and it can be mild or spicy, depending on your tastes. The curry 
            roux, from no heat to very spicy, can be bought at any international grocery 
            store. It can be served over white rice or with udon noodles. This recipe is 
            very flexible; it can easily be made for more or less people. It can also be 
            frozen (don't put the potatoes in).</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil, or more as needed</li>
            <li>1 ¾ pounds beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes</li>
            <li>3 onions, quartered</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon ketchup</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper, or to taste (Optional)</li>
            <li>water to cover</li>
            <li>4 carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>1 cube chicken bouillon (Optional)</li>
            <li>3 medium potatoes, cut into 3-inch chunks</li>
            <li>1 ½ (3.5 ounce) containers Japanese curry roux, or more to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in a 6-quart pot over medium-high heat. Add beef and saute until 
                brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onions and cook until starting to soften, about 
                3 minutes. Add ketchup and Worcestershire sauce. Stir to coat. Add cayenne 
                pepper. Pour in water to cover mixture by 1 or 2 inches. Add carrots and 
                bouillon.</li>
            <li>Simmer, skimming fat off the surface of the broth as needed, for 30 minutes. 
                Add potatoes. Stir in 1 package of curry roux and let dissolve; add remaining 
                curry as needed to achieve desired thickness. Continue simmering until beef and 
                vegetables are tender, about 30 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
